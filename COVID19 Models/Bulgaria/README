This example is intended to show the use of General Branching Processes as a model of epidemics. 
It does not claim it will predict accurately the future development of the epidemics as the model is sensitive to many parameters that are difficult to measure and require more data. 
However, the model seems useful for showing the impact of different model inputs to the epidemics' development and could be useful for understanding the dynamics of the virus.
Some of the input parameters are taken from articles about the virus and some estimated based on what we observe as numbers in Bulgaria.

If you want to update the data, first download the newest data from https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv  and put it in data.csv file.
The example is country specific, so for another country you need to change some of the parameters of the model!
As new data is comming constantly you may need to adjust the parameters to fit the new data, e.g. the value of R0, which changes dynamically.
