%% Modelling COVID-19 with a General Branching Process (GBP), also called Crump-Mode-Jagers branching process
% The example is built for the specifics of the data and the quarantine in Bulgaria.
% It includes 3 scenarios for the future R0

%% load the branching process simulator
addpath('../../')       % adds the function BranchingProcessSimulator to the path
addpath('../')          % adds the functions confInterval and readCSVData to the path

%% read and plot the data for the chosen country
% save the data from: https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv
% then write in the file data.csv
[dates, newcases_hist, totalcases_hist] = readCSVData('../data.csv', 'Indonesia');

%% Build a branching model
detection_time = 8;     % assumes 2 days after the symptoms develop (on average) the person is tested for corona
num_days_passed = dates(end)-dates(1) + 1 + detection_time;   % days passed since the infection began = days since first case + detection time needed

sim_num=100;    % number of simulations to perform
horizon=30;     % horizon in days, after the last available data
%days_before_quarantine=20;      % number of days at the beginning of the process that have a larger R0 value due to less restrictions and social distancing
T=num_days_passed+horizon;          % the simulation period for the process, from the first infected to horizon 
h=0.5;          % the time step is 0.5 day
omega=60;           % no one is infected for more than omega days, technical parameter that does not need to be accurate, smaller -> faster speed, 
                    % but it needs to be at least as large that the P(being infected after omega) is very close to zero.

%% model of S, survivability function, NOT to be mistaken with the percentage of people who survive the virus!
% S is virus specific and represents the survivability function of the virus inside the body of a person
% Here it is assumed normally distributed where the values mu and sigma are taken from the article:
% "Feasability of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts", J. Hellewell, S. Abbot, et al. 
% https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162
%
% average time for recovery in the article is 5.8 + 9.1 = 14.9, std = sqrt(2.6^2 + 19.53) = 5.1274
% however the data in bulgaria (recovery rates and active cases) seems to show that people need more time to clear the virus out of their body
% even after they are already healthy and recovered. Here a value of 25 days is used for the average days to clear the virus.
% As worldometers.info writes, the active cases and recovories depend highly on the way we count a recovery.
% In Bulgaria it is counted after a person tests negative twice for the virus.
S=(1-normcdf(0:h:omega, 30, 5.1274)')./(1-normcdf(0,30, 5.1274));    % trimmed normal life length with average of 14 days until clearance
S(end)=0;           % the chance of surviving after age omega is zero
% If you want to try exponential distribution instead, use S=(1-expcdf(0:h:omega, 14.9)')./normcdf(0,omega, 14.9);   % exponential with average of 14 days

%% other parameters for the simulator
U=1;    % no types - no mutations, there is a possibility to include a second, quarantined type here with a probability to become quarantined

H=[0, 1]';      % people infect only 1 other person when infection happens, no multiple infections

% there is no immigration in the example, but it could be included as a random variable representing the number of individuals returning to Bulgaria
% which are infected with the virus

% the initial number of infections is uniformly distributed with respect to "days passed since infection" (i.e. "age" of the infection)
% those infections have uniformly distributed "ages" on every call of the Z_0 function

%% MAIN SCENARIO, model of the Point process mu
% values are taken from the article https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162
% from onset to isolation 3.83 (var = 5.99)
% incubation 5.8 (std = 2.6)
% average time of infecting other people is 5.8 + 3.83 = 9.63, std = sqrt(2.6^2 + 5.99) = 3.5707

% R0 - average number of infected people from a single person, conditional on that person staying infected
% distribution of the infection days is taken to be gamma-like and the point process integrates to R0:
% Expectation = k * theta = 9.63, Variance = k * theta^2 = 3.5707^2 => theta = 3.5707^2 / 9.63 = 1.3240, k = 9.63/1.3240 = 7.2734
% Here we assume we have 2 periods of the epidemic - before the people started distancing themselves and after.
% R0 is chosen to fit the observed daily new cases

% The immigration is actually the number of people who returned home without any symptoms but infected other people. The ones that were diagnosed 
% get isolated and cannot infect others. Thus, this number is a pure speculation in this model as we do not have data on that. 
% But it is important to notice that we have 2 main options to fit the model to the data: though R0 and through immigration.
% Increasing R0 increases the confidence intervals and you may notice that at some point they become too wide to correspond to reality.
% If they are too wide comparing to the data, then maybe the R0 is smaller, bu we experience immigration. Immigration does not affect the confidence
% intervals as much as R0. This model combines hypothesis on R0 with hypothesis on Immigration, in order to fit the model to the total cases and new
% cases, and at the same time fit the model volatility to the observed volatility of new cases.
